UFDefense is the first innovative application database that utilizes AI power to ensure the safety of the population during natural disaster events. Our application takes in databases from twitter, and then harnesses the power of WatsonX AI in order to cross references the data, determining which event should be alerted to the public, and to generate real, fast time alerts about the natural disaster. This information then gets automatically updated into our website, giving the population reliable, precise alerts about events in their area.
Our mission is to ensure life-saving alerts prior to a storm. That’s why we’re committed to accessibility and accuracy, providing clear and understandable information for everyone. UFDefense is committed to helping users receive crucial alerts, follow developments in real time, and learn how to stay resilient in the face of natural disasters.

**Judges** Becuase our website is not yet hosted, here are the instructions to get in up on your local computer:
1) Ensure all necessary python packages are installed (pip install ntscraper, tweepy, ibm-watsonx-ai)
2) Run main.py (which will start updating the content of the website every 5 minutes)
3) cd to the Website folder, then execute python -m http.server
4) navigate to localhost:8000 

(Or just open the index.html in a live server. This will give you a website with content that was generated on 10/27/24)
