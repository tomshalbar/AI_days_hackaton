UFDefense is the first innovative application database that utilizes AI power to ensure the saftey of the population during natural disaster events. Our application takes in databases from twitter, and then harnasses the power of WatsonX AI in order to cross references the data, determining which event should be alerted to the pulic, and to generates real, fast time alerts about the natural disaster. This information then gets automaticlly updated into out website, giving the population relaible, precise alerts about events in their area. 
Our mission is to ensure life-saving alerts prior to a storm. That’s why we’re committed to accessibility and accuracy, providing clear and understandable information for everyone. UFDefense is committed to helping users receive crucial alerts, follow developments in real time, and learn how to stay resilient in the face of natural disasters.

**Judges** Becuase our website is not yet hosted, here are the instructions to get in up on your local computer:
1) Ensure all necessary python packages are installed
2) Run web_scraper.py (which will update the raw data JSON with real time data)
3) Run watsonInteraction.py. This could take a couple minutes. (which will take in the raw data, and update the processed data JSON with the newly AI generated content)
4) Open index.html in a live server.

(or skip steps 1-3 and just open the index.html in a live server. This will give you a website with content that was generated on 10/27/24)
